# Testing Qualification

This folder contains a Python implementation of the Round Robin CPU scheduling program converted from the provided C code.

## File
- `Round_Robin.py`: Reads process arrival/burst times and time quantum, then computes completion time (CT), waiting time (WT), and turnaround time (TAT).

## Qualification
The script is suitable for:
- Practicing Operating Systems scheduling algorithms.
- Demonstrating Round Robin logic with arrival times.
- Small interactive classroom/lab testing scenarios.
